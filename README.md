# r-timesheet-extended

A collection of timesheet management applications including:
* `admin-view` - description TBD
* `audit-view` - description TBD
* `common` - Utilities shared by two or more of the apps
* `finance-view` - description TBD
* `manager-view` - Managers can 'approve' or commend on user timesheets.
* `user-view` - Similar to the built-in timesheet application. Normal users enter time spent information for stories and tasks.

## Versions
* `1.x` branch- The original `r-timesheet-extended` set of applications. On April 12, 2018, this was moved into its own branch and tagged with `v1.0.0`
to allow access and updates to the original app if necessary.  Any customer using the original application should use this version
unless they would like to upgrade
* `master` branch - Refinements and new features to support new customer requirements.  This is the latest version, but may add (or remove)
features from the 1.x version.
